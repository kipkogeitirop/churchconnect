## 🎯 The Truth About Ranking Globally

### Why You're NOT Ranking Yet:

1. **New Domain** = Low Authority
   - Your domain is new (low trust with Google)
   - Competitors have 5-10+ years of history
   - Takes 6-12 months to build authority

2. **No Backlinks** = No Credibility
   - You need 50-100+ quality backlinks
   - Competitors have 1,000+ backlinks
   - Backlinks = 40% of Google's ranking algorithm

3. **No Content** = Nothing to Rank
   - You have 6 pages (Home, About, Features, Pricing, Clients, Contact)
   - Competitors have 100+ pages (blog posts, guides, resources)
   - Google needs content to rank you for keywords

4. **High Competition**
   - "church management software" = 33,100 searches/month
   - Dozens of established competitors
   - They spend $10,000-50,000/month on SEO
